<h1>Lightning Algorihtm (Unity)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This simulation generates random mazes with hundreds of possible tiles to pass through, and uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the fastest route, which, akin to lightning, is how it gets its name. The program made in Unity 2D, will endlessly loop through mazes that are solveable and visualise the path taken each time.
